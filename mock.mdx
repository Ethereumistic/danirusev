## How It Works Now

### Image Flow:
1. User visits product page → sees first image from **Green variant** (or Yellow if no green images)
2. User clicks "Green" → shows ALL green variant images with thumbnails
3. User clicks "Yellow" → switches to ALL yellow variant images
4. User clicks any thumbnail → that image becomes the main image
5. **No generic gallery needed!** Each variant has its own complete photo set

### Benefits:
✅ Each color gets its own photo gallery
✅ Thumbnails are clickable to zoom/change main image
✅ Selected variant shows a ring indicator
✅ No confusion with generic vs variant images

---

## How It Works

### Stock Logic:
- **Product Stock (0)** ← Ignored when you have variants
- **Green Variant Stock (3)** ← Real stock for green mugs
- **Yellow Variant Stock (2)** ← Real stock for yellow mugs
- **Total Available** = 3 + 2 = 5 mugs total

### Image Flow:
1. User visits product page → sees **Gallery images** (general mug photos)
2. User clicks "Green" → main image changes to **Green variant image**
3. User clicks "Yellow" → main image changes to **Yellow variant image**
4. Gallery thumbnails stay available for clicking

### Price Calculation:
- Base Price: 14 BGN
- Green selected: 14 + 0 = **14 BGN**
- Yellow selected: 14 + 0 = **14 BGN**

If you wanted green to cost more:
- Green price modifier: `+3`
- Green final price: 14 + 3 = **17 BGN**
